### 👋 Hi! I'm Jess Ding, aka [jessding](https://jessding.com)!

I'm a sophomore at MIT trying to take *all the classes* (:worried: just kidding! it's a marathon, not a sprint!) and make *all the things* (well, using the resources at MIT to make whatever I think of :grin:)

🙋🏻‍♀️ Pronouns: she/her  
:house: Hometown: Austin, Texas  
:art: Hobbies: :dancers: dancing, 🛠️ making, :taco: eating, drinking boba


I'm currently:

<ul>
